										<h1>Game programmer</h1>
										<p>About me</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										Greetings! My name is François, and I am a passionate game developer seeking opportunities to grow in the industry. I have always been a console and PC gamer at heart.
										Along with creating small games in Java and C++ during my computer science studies, I have also invested time in following various tutorials and working on projects using game engines
										such as Unity and Unreal Engine. This has allowed me to gain a solid understanding of game design and gameplay mechanics. <br /><br />

										In 2022, I participated in an Erasmus program with Glyndwr University where I had the opportunity to work on two significant game projects on Unreal Engine.
										In these projects, I held the role of the main gameplay programmer and also contributed to game and sound design. This experience was invaluable and reinforced my love for game development.

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/kiaGames.png" alt="" /></a>
											<p>During my Erasmus program, I was in charge of game mechanics, game design, and sound design as I developed a racing/kart game. 
											The game featured trial mode and versus AI mode, with power-ups and power-downs to enhance the challenge and enjoyment.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Murder.png" alt="" /></a>
											<p>As part of my Erasmus program, my second project involved creating a vertical slice of a story-telling/puzzle game. 
											The player assumes the role of a detective octopus who must navigate through a crime scene, discovering clues and solving puzzles and mini-games to advance the storyline. 
											The goal was to create an immersive experience that would engage players in a unique and intriguing gameplay as they unraveled the mystery.</p>
